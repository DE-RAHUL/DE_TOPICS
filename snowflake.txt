It's a named gateway that allows Snowflake users to easily connect to cloud folders and access the data stored in them.



Roles knowledge.

1) orgadmin: its new role added to snowflake latestly.

Orgadming can create diffent account in snowflake.
Can manage them.
view/show all account in organization.
list of all account region in accounts of organization.
usage information of all account created under organization
Enable database replication for an account in an organization.

In general, any other role in snowflake can grant privilliage to orgadmin so it can use warehouse.
but in orgadmin role  you cannot create object like database and table.

role inheritance 

                           Account admin

securityadmin                              sysadmin

useradmin 

public



Account admin: exclusive to this role 

create share 
import share 
monitor usage




Task: When I had created a task and given schedule time of 1 minute below is the observation.

1) task will still in suspended state.
2) you have to alter task cammand to resume task.




Resource monitor:As soon its limit got expired it did not allowed to run next task. the current task got failed and new task time shceduled automatically.



Horizontal Scaling: when may simple queries running in parallel.
Vertical scaling:when query executed are very complex.

Three different type of storing variable.

1) defining them within sql session. !define coulmn_name=value, then !set variable_substitution=true;
2) second one is defining in config file ..column_name=value.
3) defining them while connecting to snowsql.

Defining them while connecting to snowsql==> two ways of defining it 

1) -D column_name=value
2) --variable column_name=value


sampling :Bernouli or row sytem or block sampling., Bernouli is default sampling.

Block sampling for large data set. Bernouli for small data set.

we cannot limit sampling of data in block sampling. but in bernouli it is true.


connect by clause and recursive CTE?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USERS--> ETL_USERs, user are assgined to different or single role.

GRANT ROLE DATA_ANALYST TO USER ETL_USER

roles--> DATA ANALYST, DEVELOPER .

privilleges assigned to roles>
grant select,create, delete on table employee to role datanalyst.

Different privilleges can be assinged to a single user based on different roles.

Privilleges are depend on objects. 
For example: for warehouse it can be modify,usage,operate.
 for a table it can be create,delete,insert,update.

to use select privilleges on table you must have usage permission on database and schema.


----------------------------------------cost depend on 4 stuff------------------------------

1) Snowflake Edition
2) Region where snowflake account is created(east,wes)
3) cloud platform(aws,azure,gcp)
4) virtual warehouse size and storage cost.


Storage cose, compute cost,cloud service cost.

storage cost: Per terabyte charges
1) pay as you go--> $40TB/per month.
2) fixed storage--> $23TB/Per month


create or replace task PAT_MDM_DEV.CORE.PMDM_DQ_METRICS_TASK
warehouse='WH_S_DEVELOPMENT_PAT_MDM_NPROD'
schedule='USING CRON 10 8 * * * UTC'
as
call PAT_MDM_DEV.CORE.PMDM_DQ_METRICS();


select current_TIME();

ALTER TASK PAT_MDM_DEV.CORE.PMDM_DQ_METRICS_TASK RESUME;
